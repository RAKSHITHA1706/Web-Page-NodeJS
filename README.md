Topic- My Opinion
A Web Application of managing the Feedbacks. MyOpinion (A Web Application which is used to manage the Feedbacks)
INSTRUCTIONS TO RUN THE CODE :
• In the Visual Studio Codes or any other Editors which you are using in their open the Folder called “MyOpinion”.
• And then in the terminal/console- run the command: npm start
• There is a line(“start: nodemon index”)inside the package.json file, here index.js is a file which is the starting point of the project.
• So by running the npm start command it reaches the starting point and starts by connecting the server to the port (here we have used 9898 as the port).
• And as we have used the mongoose package to connect to the database ,the mongodb database also gets successfully connected once the server is connected to the port.
In the Terminal: Server Connected
Database Successfully Connected
• Then in your web browser you will have to use localhost:port-no/MyOpinion as the url which leads to the home page of the MyOpinion web page.
• You can also check the database stored in mongodb by using the mongodb compass.
